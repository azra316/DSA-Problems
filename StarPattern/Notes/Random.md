### What is Symmetry in Star Patterns?

*Symmetry means both halves of a pattern mirror each other.
In star patterns, symmetry usually happens vertically (top vs bottom) or horizontally (left vs right), but in our beginner patterns, we focus on vertical symmetry, meaning stars increase then decrease.

# ðŸŒŸ Categories of Star Patterns

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Only Increasing**

* Stars keep increasing row by row.
  Examples:

```
*
**
***
****
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Only Decreasing**

* Stars keep decreasing row by row.
  Examples:

```
****
***
**
*
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Increasing + Decreasing**

* Stars first increase, then decrease.
  Two cases:
* Odd peak (single middle row)
* Even peak (double middle rows)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Decreasing + Increasing**

* Stars first decrease, then increase.
  Two cases:
* Odd valley (single middle row)
* Even valley (double middle rows)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Symmetry (Leftâ€“Right Mirror)**

* Stars form symmetry along a vertical axis.
  Examples:
* Full pyramid (triangle)
* Inverted pyramid
* Diamond (top increasing + bottom decreasing with spaces)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Hollow Patterns**

* Instead of filled stars, only border stars are printed.
  Examples:
* Hollow square
* Hollow triangle
* Hollow diamond

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Number / Character Patterns**

* Same structure as stars, but using numbers or alphabets.
  Examples:

```
1
12
123
```

or

```
A
AB
ABC
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. **Special / Advanced Shapes**

* Mix of spaces + stars â†’ makes shapes like:
* Right-angled triangle
* Left-angled triangle
* Pyramid
* Diamond
* Hourglass
* Butterfly
* Sandglass

---

âœ… So, in **main classification terms**:

1. Only Increasing
2. Only Decreasing
3. Increasing + Decreasing (Mountain)
4. Decreasing + Increasing (Valley)
5. Symmetry (Leftâ€“Right / Pyramid / Diamond)
6. Hollow Versions
7. Number/Alphabet Variants
8. Special Shapes (Butterfly, Hourglass, etc.)

---

ðŸ‘‰ If you only want **basic star patterns (not with numbers/alphabets)**, then the **core 4 types** are:

* Increasing
* Decreasing
* Increasing + Decreasing
* Decreasing + Increasing

---

* First **Parent Category** (Symmetry / Non-Symmetry)
* Then **Sub-Parent Category** (Increasing, Decreasing, Increasing+Decreasing, etc.)
* Then **Child patterns** (Pyramid, Diamond, etc.)

---

# ðŸŒŸ Star Pattern Categories (Well-Structured)

---

## **Parent 1 â†’ Non-Symmetry (No spaces, only stars)**

### ðŸ”¹ Sub-Parent A: Increasing

* Right-angled triangle (increasing stars)

```
*
**
***
****
```

### ðŸ”¹ Sub-Parent B: Decreasing

* Inverted right-angled triangle

```
****
***
**
*
```

### ðŸ”¹ Sub-Parent C: Increasing + Decreasing (Mountain)

* Odd Peak
* Even Peak

### ðŸ”¹ Sub-Parent D: Decreasing + Increasing (Valley)

* Odd Valley
* Even Valley

---

## **Parent 2 â†’ Symmetry with Spaces**

(Here spaces are used to center/shift stars)

### ðŸ”¹ Sub-Parent A: Increasing Symmetry with Spaces

* Pyramid (centered increasing triangle)

```
   *
  ***
 *****
```

### ðŸ”¹ Sub-Parent B: Decreasing Symmetry with Spaces

* Inverted Pyramid

```
 *****
  ***
   *
```

### ðŸ”¹ Sub-Parent C: Increasing + Decreasing Symmetry with Spaces

* Diamond / Rhombus

```
   *
  ***
 *****
  ***
   *
```

### ðŸ”¹ Sub-Parent D: Decreasing + Increasing Symmetry with Spaces

* Hourglass / Sandglass

```
 *****
  ***
   *
  ***
 *****
```

### ðŸ”¹ Sub-Parent E: Mixed Symmetry with Spaces

* Butterfly

```
*     *
**   **
*** ***
*******
```

* Left/Right Shifted Triangles

```
   *
  **
 ***
****
```

---

âœ… So the **Final Hierarchy** is:

1. **Non-Symmetry (No spaces)**

   * Increasing
   * Decreasing
   * Increasing + Decreasing (Mountain)
   * Decreasing + Increasing (Valley)

2. **Symmetry with Spaces**

   * Increasing Symmetry â†’ Pyramid
   * Decreasing Symmetry â†’ Inverted Pyramid
   * Increasing + Decreasing Symmetry â†’ Diamond
   * Decreasing + Increasing Symmetry â†’ Hourglass
   * Mixed Symmetry â†’ Butterfly, Shifted Triangles

---

ðŸ‘‰ This way, every pattern (spaces or no spaces) fits into a **Parent â†’ Sub-Parent â†’ Child** structure.

---

Do you want me to also include **Hollow versions** in this same structure (like Hollow Pyramid under "Symmetry with Spaces") so the map becomes 100% complete?
