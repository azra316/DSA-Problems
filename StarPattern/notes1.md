#  “condition of `j`” confusion crystal clear.
# thought process + chart method.

---

## 1️⃣ Step 1: Fix your `i` (rows)

* `i` = which **row** you are on.
* So if `n = 5`, `i` will always go from `0 → 4` (or `1 → 5` depending on your choice).

---

## 2️⃣ Step 2: Ask: "What should happen in each row?"

Here’s the trick:

* `j` controls **what happens inside the row** (how many stars/numbers/spaces etc).
* So to find condition of `j`, you just need to think:
  👉 “In row `i`, how many things should be printed?”

---

## 3️⃣ Step 3: Turn words into numbers

Example:

* Row 0 → 1 star
* Row 1 → 2 stars
* Row 2 → 3 stars

So formula = `i + 1 stars`.
That means:

```js
for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++)
```

---

## 4️⃣ Step 4: Make a **thinking chart**

Here’s the clear picture 👇

| Row (i) | What I want printed in that row | How many prints? | j condition      |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 0       | 1 star                          | 1                | j = 0 → 0 (<= i) |
| 1       | 2 stars                         | 2                | j = 0 → 1 (<= i) |
| 2       | 3 stars                         | 3                | j = 0 → 2 (<= i) |
| 3       | 4 stars                         | 4                | j = 0 → 3 (<= i) |
| 4       | 5 stars                         | 5                | j = 0 → 4 (<= i) |

So condition is always:
👉 `j <= i`

---

## 5️⃣ Step 5: If pattern is reverse

Suppose:

* Row 0 → 5 stars
* Row 1 → 4 stars
* Row 2 → 3 stars

That means formula = `n - i stars`.

Chart 👇

| Row (i) | Stars needed | j range | Condition |
| ------- | ------------ | ------- | --------- |
| 0       | 5            | 0 → 4   | j < n - i |
| 1       | 4            | 0 → 3   | j < n - i |
| 2       | 3            | 0 → 2   | j < n - i |

---

## 🎯 THE GOLDEN RULE

👉 **i = row number**
👉 **j = count inside row**

To get condition of `j` →

1. Write down how many elements should be in each row.
2. Convert it into formula (`i+1`, `n-i`, `2*i+1`, etc).
3. Use that formula as your **j limit**.

---

## Example: Pyramid (odd numbers of stars)

Row → Stars = `2*i + 1`

Chart 👇

| i | Stars | j range | Condition  |
| - | ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| 0 | 1     | 0 → 0   | j < 2\*i+1 |
| 1 | 3     | 0 → 2   | j < 2\*i+1 |
| 2 | 5     | 0 → 4   | j < 2\*i+1 |

So:

```js
for (let j = 0; j < 2*i+1; j++)
```

---

✅ That’s the full thought process:

* **Fix i** → decide rows
* **Count what you need in each row** → make formula
* **Apply formula in j condition**
